This site allows users to quickly sign up for an account by interfacing with the Freshbooks/Stripe API to process payments. It helps them share time on the machines by letting them reserve time on a calendar for each machine up to the daily and weekly limits without allowing double booking. It also gives admins a way to address problems quickly by giving users an interface to report broken machines. Our solution gives the Nordeast Makers back the valuable time they need to continue their passion: making things.

Tammy is a force for social change and now she has a site that can keep pace with her ideas, broadcast her voice to the world and bring people off the page and into the door of her shop.

                       p Tapestry Folkdance Center is over thirty years old and their website and logo was showing the years. They needed to draw in new young dancers with a fresh look that could be viewed on phones and was easy for staff to update and maintain. With the help of a member of the community who acted as a sound board and guide, I built Tapestry a solution using WordPress with a custom child theme. This new site is helping bring in a younger crowd of dancers by being easy to read on any device and being attractive and colorful with photos and videos of the dances and an updated color logo. The solution gives back time to the part time staff at Tapestry by being easy to update with the WordPress interface and the Website Users Guide I wrote. Now Tapestry has the tools to attract new dancers so they can be ready for the next 30 years. Happy Dancing!
